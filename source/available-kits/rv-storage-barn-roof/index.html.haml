    %h2 RV Shelter Roof

  %section.content
    :markdown
      The RV Shelter Roof Kit was designed as the low cost alternative to the enclosed RV storage building. The RV shelter is offered in three widths: 16', 20' and 24' as well as lengths from 36' to 60', each with a standard 14' ceiling.  These heights should accommodate most RV sizes and provide quality RV garages or RV shelters.

      The RV shelter roof kit includes all the material to build the RV shelter shown above, in the particular size that you order.  You will have the option to choose your metal color from the many colors available on the chart included on our [Metal Color Options](/metal-color-options/) page.

      All RV shelters are designed with 6×6 pressure treated posts with at least 20% of the exposed post length in the ground.  Each post is secured with 80 lbs of concrete.  All RV shelter roof kits will have pressure treated 2×6 wind braces and pressure treated 2×10 beam material.  Beams are notched into the posts and secured by carriage bolts to give the maximum strength possible.  All of our building kits use engineered roof trusses made of southern yellow pine, which meets building code requirements anywhere in the U.S., and are stripped with 2×4 roof purlins every 2'.  We also provide 29 ga painted metal and the matching screws, with a minimum of a 25 year guarantee for the roof and gable ends.
