      Arbor Wood Products Horse Barn Roof Kits are available in a number of sizes, which are listed below.  The horse barn roof is designed with the center raised to give it that genuine old-time barn look.  We have standard widths and lengths of kits prefigured for both price and material ,but we can customize a roof kit in width, length or ceiling height, to meet your particular need upon [request](/contact-us).

      The horse barn roof kit includes all the material to build the barn style shown above, in the particular size that you order.  You will have the option to choose your metal color from the many colors available on the chart included on our [Metal Color Options](/metal-color-options/) page.

      All non-enclosed kits are designed with 6×6 pressure treated posts with at least 20% of the exposed post length in the ground.  Each post is secured with 80 lbs of concrete.  All pole barn roof kits will have pressure treated 2 x 6 wind braces and pressure treated 2×10 or 2×12 beam material, depending on the barn width.  Beams are notched into the posts and secured by carriage bolts to give the maximum strength possible.  All of our building kits use engineered roof trusses made of southern yellow pine, which meets building code requirements anywhere in the U.S., and are stripped with 2×4 roof purlins every 2'.  We also provide 29 ga painted metal and the matching screws, with a minimum of a 25 year guarantee for the roof and gable ends.
