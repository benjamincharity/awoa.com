      Arbor Wood Products Enclosed Horse Barn Kits are available in a number of sizes, which are listed below.  The horse barn roof is designed with the center raised, to give it the look of a genuine, old-time barn.  We have standard widths and lengths of kits prefigured for both price and material, but we can customize an enclosed kit, in width, length or ceiling height, for your particular need upon [request](/contact-us/).

      The Enclosed Horse Barn Kit includes all the material to build the barn style shown above, in the particular size that you order.  You will have the option to choose your metal colors from the many colors available on the chart included on our [Metal Color Options](/metal-color-options/) page.

      All kits are designed with 6×6 pressure treated posts with at least 20% of the exposed post length in the ground.  Each post is secured with 80 lbs of concrete.  All enclosed pole barns use 2×10 or 2×12 beam materials, depending on barn width.  Beams are notched into the posts and secured by carriage bolts to give the maximum strength possible.  All of our building kits use engineered roof trusses, made of southern yellow pine, which meet building code requirements anywhere in the U.S.  The trusses and posts are stripped with 2×4 roof and wall purlins every 2'.  We also provide 29 ga painted metal and the matching screws, with a minimum of a 25 year guarantee, for the roof, wall and gable ends.  Each enclosed kit comes with one sliding track door.
