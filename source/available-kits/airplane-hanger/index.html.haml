      The Arbor Wood Products airplane hanger kit, also referred to as an airplane barn, is designed with the front and back of the building open for easy entry and exit of your plane.  The airplane hanger kits are available in the standard 40' or 50' widths and lengths of up to 60', all with the standard 12' ceiling height.  We can customize the airplane barn to accommodate your particular needs upon [request](/contact/).

      The airplane hanger kit includes all the material to build the building style shown above, in the particular size that you order.  You will have the option to choose your metal colors from the many colors available on the chart included on our [Metal Color Options](/metal-color-options/) page.

      All non-enclosed kits are designed with 6 x 6 pressure treated posts, with at least 20% of the exposed post length in the ground, secured with 80 lbs of concrete.  All airplane hanger kits use 2×12 beam materials.  Beams are notched into the posts and secured by carriage bolts to give the maximum strength possible.  All of our building kits use engineered roof trusses, made of southern yellow pine, which meet building code requirements anywhere in the U.S.  The trusses and posts are stripped with 2×4 roof and wall purlins every 2'.  We also provide 29 ga painted metal and the matching screws, with a minimum of a 25 year guarantee, for the roof, wall and gable ends.
